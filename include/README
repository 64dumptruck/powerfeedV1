# powerfeedV1

This is a project to make a universal powerfeed controler for a milling machine.

The arduino nano was selected for its inexpensive cost, and small footprint. There is a provided schmatic for the connection of the pins. Pin selection can be changed, but this also must be changed in the code.

Installation:

Installed and tested on an elegoo nano 328, with platform IO
